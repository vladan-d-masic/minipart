    <br />
    <p>
      The intensive development in mining regions leads to substantial and
      predominantly negative changes in the local community and its environment
      (mono-functional economy; environmental degradation; relocation).<br />Resistance
      from the community and experts towards mining activities in Serbia has
      intensified since the 2000s, increasing the significance of public
      participation in the planning of mining areas. MINIPART is designed as a
      research project that combines qualitative and quantitative research
      methods to create the most suitable methods for public participation in
      mining regions, including vulnerable groups. These defined methods will
      facilitate and motivate the participation of all stakeholders in planning,
      reduce conflicts, and enable the balancing of the needs of citizens,
      industry, and government, not only in mining regions but elsewhere as
      well.

    <p>
      The main objective of MINIPART is to identify the most appropriate
      participation methods, tailored to all stakeholders in mining areas. These
      methods will provide the most efficient means for stakeholders to
      influence decision-making, thereby enhancing their quality of work and
      life (social, environmental, economic) and ensuring sustainable
      development.<br /><br />
      The specific objectives:<br />
      (1) To compile a comprehensive repository of available examples of
      participatory planning in mining areas.<br />
      (2) To engage all stakeholders (citizens, mining industry, government,
      NGOs, environmentalists) actively in the identification of the best
      participatory methods through interviews, surveys, and focus groups.<br />
      (3) To address the specific needs of vulnerable groups (women, ethnic
      minorities, rural populations, persons with disabilities, the elderly, and
      youth) in the process of identifying the most suitable participatory
      methods.<br />
      (4) To develop new or adapted approaches for meaningful and inclusive
      community participation in mining planning and development.<br />
      (5) To widely disseminate the results to all project participants, the
      national and local governmental sectors, the NGO sector, citizens in
      Serbia and abroad, academia, professionals, and the general public.

      <p>
        IAUS is a research and development institute in the fields of urbanism,
        architecture, spatial planning, environmental protection, civil
        engineering, and transport. Since 1954, it has been engaged in research
        and academic publishing activities. Since the 1980s, IAUS has also been
        the leading institution in Serbia for consulting services in mining
        regions, resulting in several mining-oriented scientific projects. It is
        the only public institution that integrates research and practice in
        urban and spatial planning with environmental protection. This unique
        position enables IAUS to directly transfer theoretical results into the
        public participation process.
