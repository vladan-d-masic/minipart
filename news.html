    <h2>
      June 2025
      <br />
      Training in MAXQDA Software for Data Analysis
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      As part of the regular activities of the MINIPART project, a two-day
      training session on qualitative and quantitative data analysis using
      MAXQDA software was held in early June at the premises of the Institute of
      Architecture and Urban &amp; Spatial Planning of Serbia (IAUS).
    </p>
    <p>
      The training was attended by all members of the MINIPART research team. At
      the invitation of the principal investigator, several additional
      colleagues from IAUS and project collaborators from the survey phase
      conducted in the city of Bor and the municipality of Majdanpek also joined
      the sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The training focused on mastering key MAXQDA functions — including coding,
      code systematisation, paraphrasing, case comparison, code correlation, and
      data visualisation. However, the knowledge, proactivity, and patience of
      the instructor, Dr. Vladan Vidicki, enriched the experience far beyond
      expectations. In addition to technical guidance, participants were
      introduced to fundamental principles of interview analysis and focus group
      research.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Vladan Vidicki is an Assistant Professor at the Faculty of Philosophy,
      University of Novi Sad, with extensive experience in applying MAXQDA tools
      in social science research.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MINIPART team will apply the knowledge gained to analyse expert
      interviews conducted in March and April 2025, and later during the work
      with focus groups planned for October 2025.

      September 2024
      <br />
      Professional visit to Tara Mine, Navan, Ireland
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      The MINIPART project team paid a study visit to the Tara zinc mine in
      Navan, Republic of Ireland, the largest zinc mine in Europe and one of the
      largest in the world. At the mine’s headquarters, the team was hosted by
      Mr. Paschal Walsh – Environmental, Health, and Safety Manager, along with
      his colleagues Michelle Geraghty and Damien Lynch. Through a presentation
      and discussions, the hosts introduced the mine’s operational model, their
      current practice of collaboration with the local community and other
      stakeholders, as well as the compensation modalities they have
      implemented. The dynamic discussion further contributed to the
      understanding of the differing contexts of mine development and mining
      activities in Ireland and Serbia, as well as their place within the urban
      and spatial planning systems.

      The MINIPART project team paid a study visit to the School of
      Architecture, Planning and Environmental Policy at the University College
      Dublin (UCD). The invitation for the professional visit and lecture came
      from Prof. Dr. Ana Perić Momčilović – the external collaborator in the
      MINIPART team, and her colleagues Prof. Dr. Paula Russell and Prof. Dr.
      Brendan Williams. On this occasion, the members of the MINIPART team
      exchanged experiences with colleagues on the topic of public participation
      in Serbia and Ireland. A discussion with other colleagues and students
      followed after the team delivered lectures on the topic “Improving
      Participation in the Spatial Planning of Mining Areas”, during which they
      presented the MINIPART project and some preliminary results.

      July 2024
      <br />
      The MINIPART project team has started training surveyors
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      The training of surveyors was held at the premises of the Institute for
      Architecture and Urban Planning of Serbia. Dr. Milena Toković (Faculty of
      Geography, University of Belgrade) and MA Dušanka Milosavljević (Institute
      for Philosophy and Social Theory) conveyed theoretical and practical
      knowledge to the young survey team, which the surveyors will apply in
      fieldwork with the residents of the City of Bor and the Municipality of
      Majdanpek during this summer. The survey aims to assess the level of
      citizen engagement in this mining region in urban and spatial planning, as
      well as to gain insight into their views on the most appropriate methods
      of participation in decision- making.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prof. Dr. Milovan Vuković (Technical Faculty in Bor, University of
      Belgrade) introduced a smaller part of the survey team in Bor to the
      basics of the task, the details followed via the Zoom application. The
      research results will serve as input data for the upcoming phases of the
      project and as the basis for an academic article.
