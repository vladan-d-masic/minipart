  Welcome to our search page for publications on participation! You can search
  publications by keywords, country, and method. The “Methods” dropdown menu
  includes terms that refer not only to methods, but also to approaches,
  techniques, and communication channels used in public participation processes
  in decision-making. A detailed categorisation of methods, along with their
  descriptions, can be found on the “Formal Methods” and “Informal Methods”
  pages.
