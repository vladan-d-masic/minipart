                        <p>BSc, MSc and Dr. rer. nat. – PhD in spatial planning. Her interest in demographic aspects, mountain areas, and sustainability required a combination of social and statistical design, integrating qualitative and quantitative approaches. She has been using interviews and surveys as tools for data collection since her PhD thesis. Her experience includes working with people and focus groups. Public participation has always been part of her analysis of mountain and protected areas and has been her primary focus since 2021.

                        <p>Since obtaining my PhD (2013) in Urban Planning, I have studied the processes and practices of
                            stakeholder collaboration in addressing complex spatial problems across various socio-spatial
                            settings. Observing through the lenses of planning theory, planning methods, and empirical tools, I
                            analyse the nature and implementation of different collaborative procedures and their
                            consequences for social learning and democratic urban governance. Within the domain of
                            comparative studies, I explore various topics across scales of institutional landscapes and planning
                            cultures.</p>
